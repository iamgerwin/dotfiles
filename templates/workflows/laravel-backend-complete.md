- Postman CLI: Available if needed
- GitHub CLI: gh (authenticated and ready to use)
- Scripts available in: ~/ai-prompts/projects/[project-name]/scripts/

## DEVELOPMENT WORKFLOW

### Phase 1: Analysis & Planning
1. Use ClickUp API to retrieve complete ticket details, all comments, all attachments and all subtasks
2. Check Postman for existing API documentation (use CLI tools)
3. Review any Figma links for design references
4. Examine all attachments and documentation
5. Create comprehensive implementation plan covering:
   - Main requirements breakdown
   - Technical approach and architecture
   - Task prioritization and dependencies

### Phase 2: Implementation & Git Workflow
1. Update ticket status to "In Progress" using ClickUp API
2. Ensure you're on develop branch: `git checkout develop && git pull origin develop`
3. Create feature branch from develop: `git checkout -b feature/ticket-[ID]-[short-title]`
4. Implement each requirement with:
   - Small, focused commits with clear messages
   - Comprehensive error handling
   - Documentation updates
   - Don't update an existing database migration file, only create one if needed
   - Place the document md files in docs/[proper-category]/[doc-filename].md
   - Do not make any changes until you have 95% confidence that you know what to build - ask follow up questions until you have that confidence
5. Push branch: `git push origin feature/ticket-[ID]`
6. Create Pull Request into develop using GitHub CLI:
```bash
gh pr create \
  --base develop \
  --title "[TICKET-ID] Brief description" \
  --body "[PR description]"
```
7. Update ticket status to "Code Review" using ClickUp API

### Phase 3: Documentation & Communication
Add detailed plain text comment to ClickUp ticket with:
- Work completed summary
- Technical implementation details
- PR link and branch name
- Next steps or dependencies
- Update Postman with new APIs (tag with date and PR)
- Post notification to Slack if significant feature
