# Dotfiles - Personal Development Environment Configuration

A modular, maintainable approach to managing shell configurations and development environment across multiple macOS machines.

## Overview

This repository contains my personal dotfiles configuration, designed with modularity and maintainability in mind. The configuration is split into logical components, making it easy to understand, modify, and sync across different workstations.

## Features

- **Modular Configuration**: Shell settings are organized into separate files by functionality
- **Cross-Machine Sync**: Easy synchronization between personal and work computers
- **Automated Setup**: One-command installation for new machines
- **Package Management**: Centralized Homebrew package management via Brewfile
- **Version Control**: All configurations tracked in Git for easy rollback and history
- **Oh My Zsh Integration**: Pre-configured with useful plugins and Powerlevel10k theme
- **Development Tools**: NVM, Pyenv, Herd PHP, and other development environment managers
- **Laravel/PHP Ready**: Aliases and tools for Laravel development workflow

## Quick Start

### ⚠️ For Users with Existing .zshrc Configuration

If you already have a working .zshrc file on your Mac, follow these steps:

#### Step 1: Pre-Installation Check (Recommended)
```bash
# Download and run the pre-check script
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/iamgerwin/dotfiles/main/scripts/pre-check.sh | bash
```
This will analyze your current setup and provide recommendations.

#### Step 2: Backup Your Custom Settings
```bash
# Create a backup of your current configuration
cp ~/.zshrc ~/.zshrc.personal.backup

# Extract your custom aliases and functions to preserve them
grep -E '^(alias|export|function)' ~/.zshrc > ~/.zshrc.local
```

#### Step 3: Install Dotfiles
```bash
# Clone and install
git clone https://github.com/iamgerwin/dotfiles.git ~/dotfiles
cd ~/dotfiles
./setup.sh
```

Your existing .zshrc will be automatically backed up to `~/.dotfiles-backup/`

### 🆕 For New Mac or Fresh Installation

Run this single command:

```bash
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/iamgerwin/dotfiles/main/setup.sh)"
```

This will:
1. Install Homebrew (if not present)
2. Clone this repository
3. Create backups of any existing configurations
4. Install all packages from Brewfile
5. Set up symbolic links
6. Configure your shell environment

### 🔒 Safety Features

Every installation automatically:
- **Creates timestamped backups** before making any changes
- **Stores backups** in `~/.dotfiles-backup/` with a JSON manifest
- **Preserves all original files** with timestamps
- **Provides instant rollback** capability via `uninstall.sh`
- **Never overwrites** without backing up first

### 📖 Detailed Installation Guide

## Configuration Files

### Core Modules

- **aliases.zsh**: Command shortcuts including:
  - Git workflow aliases (gc, gpod, gdog, gclean, gdp)
  - Laravel/PHP development (art, sail, pint, pbc)
  - Docker shortcuts (dps, dpsa, di, dex)
  - System utilities (brewu, reload, dotfiles)
- **exports.zsh**: PATH and environment variables for:
  - Herd PHP configuration (multiple PHP versions)
  - NVM (Node Version Manager)
  - Pyenv (Python Version Manager)
  - Windsurf, Homebrew, and other tools
- **functions.zsh**: Reusable shell functions for productivity
- **options.zsh**: Zsh behavior settings (history, completion, etc.)
- **plugins.zsh**: Configurations for:
  - Oh My Zsh with Powerlevel10k theme
  - Development plugins (git, docker, laravel, composer)
  - Auto-suggestions and syntax highlighting
  - NVM and Pyenv initialization
- **keybindings.zsh**: Terminal keyboard shortcuts
- **prompt.zsh**: Additional prompt customization
- **custom.zsh**: Local overrides and machine-specific settings
- **p10k.zsh**: Powerlevel10k prompt configuration

### Package Management

The `Brewfile` contains all Homebrew packages, casks, and fonts. To manage packages:

```bash
# Install all packages
brew bundle install

# Update all packages
brew bundle update

# Check what would be cleaned up
brew bundle cleanup --dry-run

# Remove packages not in Brewfile
brew bundle cleanup
```

## Syncing Between Machines

### Pull Latest Changes

```bash
cd ~/dotfiles
git pull
brew bundle install  # Install any new packages
source ~/.zshrc      # Reload configuration
```

### Push Local Changes

```bash
cd ~/dotfiles
git add .
git commit -m "Update configurations"
git push
```

### Update All Packages

```bash
# Update Homebrew and all packages
brew update && brew upgrade && brew cleanup

# Update package list in Brewfile
brew bundle dump --force --file=~/dotfiles/Brewfile
```

## Customization

### Machine-Specific Settings

Create a `.zshrc.local` file in your home directory for machine-specific configurations that shouldn't be shared:

```bash
echo "export WORK_SPECIFIC_VAR=value" >> ~/.zshrc.local
```

### Private/Sensitive Data

Store sensitive information in `~/.zshrc.private` (not tracked by Git):

```bash
echo "export SECRET_API_KEY=xxx" >> ~/.zshrc.private
```

## Maintenance

### Adding New Packages

1. Install the package:
   ```bash
   brew install <package>
   ```

2. Update Brewfile:
   ```bash
   brew bundle dump --force --file=~/dotfiles/Brewfile
   ```

3. Commit changes:
   ```bash
   cd ~/dotfiles
   git add Brewfile
   git commit -m "Add <package> to Brewfile"
   git push
   ```

### Removing Packages

1. Edit the `Brewfile` and remove the package line
2. Run cleanup:
   ```bash
   brew bundle cleanup
   ```

## Backup and Rollback

### Viewing Backups

List all available backups:
```bash
~/dotfiles/scripts/backup.sh list
```

### Manual Backup

Create a backup of current configuration:
```bash
~/dotfiles/scripts/backup.sh
```

### Uninstalling Dotfiles

Complete removal with automatic restoration of original files:
```bash
~/dotfiles/scripts/uninstall.sh
```

This will:
1. Restore your original configuration files from backup
2. Remove all symbolic links
3. Optionally remove the dotfiles repository
4. Optionally clean up backup files

### Quick Restore

Restore configuration without full uninstall:
```bash
~/dotfiles/scripts/uninstall.sh restore
```

## Troubleshooting

### Shell Not Loading Configuration

Ensure the symbolic link is correct:
```bash
ls -la ~/.zshrc
# Should point to ~/dotfiles/.zshrc
```

### Homebrew Issues

Re-run the Homebrew installation:
```bash
~/dotfiles/scripts/install-brew.sh
```

### Permission Issues

Fix permissions on the dotfiles directory:
```bash
chmod -R 755 ~/dotfiles
```

### Backup Recovery

If something goes wrong, backups are stored in:
```bash
~/.dotfiles-backup/
```

View backup manifest:
```bash
cat ~/.dotfiles-backup/manifest.json | jq
```
