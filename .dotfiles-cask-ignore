# Homebrew Cask Ignore List
# ==========================
# One cask token per line to skip from upgrade/remediation cycles.
# Lines starting with # are comments and blank lines are ignored.
#
# Purpose:
# - Prevents time-consuming downloads for problematic casks
# - Excludes casks with known transient failures (download issues, vendor problems)
# - Skips casks you want to manage manually
#
# How it works:
# 1. Pre-emptive exclusion: Casks listed here are excluded BEFORE brew upgrade runs
# 2. This saves time by not attempting downloads that are known to fail
# 3. The script will log which casks are being excluded
#
# When to add a cask here:
# - Vendor download failures (CDN issues, deprecated apps)
# - App source conflicts (missing /Applications/*.app)
# - Caskroom version conflicts
# - Manual version management preference
#
# How to add:
# 1. Add the cask token (not the app name) one per line
# 2. You can find the token with: brew list --cask
# 3. Or check your Brewfile for the exact token
#
# Example problematic casks (uncomment to use):
# arc                        # App source occasionally missing
# opera                      # Caskroom conflicts
# firefox@developer-edition  # Version management issues
# vivaldi                    # App source path issues
# alt-tab                    # Occasional conflicts
