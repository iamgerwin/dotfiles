- Alternative: Use **Docker Desktop** (already installed) for full-stack environments
- Herd provides better performance and modern PHP version management

**For Python version management:**
- Use `pyenv install <version>` to install specific Python versions
- Use `.python-version` files in projects for automatic version switching
- System Python 3.12 remains available as fallback
