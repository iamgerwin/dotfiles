# Scrum Agile Framework - Best Practices Guide

## Overview
Scrum is an iterative, incremental framework for managing product development. It's built on empirical process control theory, emphasizing transparency, inspection, and adaptation.

## Core Components

### 1. Scrum Team Roles

#### Product Owner
- **Single point of accountability** for product value
- Maintains and prioritizes Product Backlog
- Ensures team understands requirements
- Makes decisions on feature priority
- Available for clarification during Sprint

#### Scrum Master
- **Servant leader** facilitating Scrum process
- Removes impediments blocking team progress
- Coaches team on Scrum practices
- Shields team from external interruptions
- Facilitates Scrum ceremonies

#### Development Team
- **Self-organizing** cross-functional group (3-9 members)
- Collectively responsible for delivering increments
- No individual titles or sub-teams
- Estimates work effort
- Commits to Sprint goals

### 2. Scrum Artifacts

#### Product Backlog
```markdown
# Product Backlog Structure
- User Stories (As a... I want... So that...)
- Technical Debt items
- Research spikes
- Bug fixes
- Infrastructure improvements

# Prioritization Techniques
- MoSCoW (Must/Should/Could/Won't)
- Value vs Effort matrix
- WSJF (Weighted Shortest Job First)
```

#### Sprint Backlog
- Selected Product Backlog items for current Sprint
- Detailed task breakdown
- Daily updated progress tracking
- Visible to entire organization

#### Product Increment
- Sum of all completed Product Backlog items
- Must meet Definition of Done
- Potentially shippable product
- Demonstrated in Sprint Review

### 3. Scrum Events

#### Sprint Planning
**Duration**: Max 8 hours for 4-week Sprint

**Part 1 - What**
- Review Product Backlog priorities
- Define Sprint Goal
- Select items for Sprint

**Part 2 - How**
- Break down user stories into tasks
- Estimate effort (hours/story points)
- Identify dependencies
- Confirm team capacity

#### Daily Scrum
**Duration**: 15 minutes maximum

**Three Questions Format**:
1. What did I complete yesterday?
2. What will I work on today?
3. Are there any impediments?

**Best Practices**:
- Same time and place daily
- Stand-up format encourages brevity
- Focus on progress toward Sprint Goal
- Park detailed discussions for after

#### Sprint Review
**Duration**: Max 4 hours for 4-week Sprint

**Activities**:
- Demonstrate completed work
- Gather stakeholder feedback
- Review Product Backlog changes
- Discuss release timeline
- Adjust priorities based on feedback

#### Sprint Retrospective
**Duration**: Max 3 hours for 4-week Sprint

**Format Examples**:
- Start, Stop, Continue
- Mad, Sad, Glad
- 4 L's (Liked, Learned, Lacked, Longed for)
- Sailboat (Wind, Anchor, Rocks)

**Action Items**:
- Identify 1-3 improvements
- Add to next Sprint Backlog
- Follow up on previous actions

## Implementation Best Practices

### 1. User Story Writing

#### INVEST Criteria
- **I**ndependent - Stories can be developed separately
- **N**egotiable - Details can be discussed
- **V**aluable - Delivers value to users
- **E**stimable - Team can estimate effort
- **S**mall - Fits within one Sprint
- **T**estable - Clear acceptance criteria

#### User Story Template
```
As a [type of user]
I want [goal/desire]
So that [benefit/value]

Acceptance Criteria:
- Given [context]
- When [action]
- Then [outcome]
```

### 2. Estimation Techniques

#### Planning Poker
- Fibonacci sequence (1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21)
- T-shirt sizes (XS, S, M, L, XL)
- Simultaneous reveal prevents anchoring
- Discussion on outliers

#### Velocity Tracking
```
Sprint Velocity = Sum of completed story points

Average Velocity = (Last 3-5 Sprints total) / Number of Sprints

Capacity Planning = Average Velocity × Focus Factor (0.6-0.8)
```

### 3. Definition of Done (DoD)

#### Sample DoD Checklist
- [ ] Code complete and committed
- [ ] Unit tests written and passing (>80% coverage)
- [ ] Integration tests passing
- [ ] Code reviewed by peer
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] No critical bugs
- [ ] Performance requirements met
- [ ] Security scan passed
- [ ] Deployed to staging environment
- [ ] Product Owner acceptance

### 4. Sprint Metrics

#### Key Performance Indicators
- **Velocity**: Story points completed per Sprint
- **Burndown Chart**: Work remaining vs time
- **Burnup Chart**: Work completed vs scope
- **Sprint Goal Success Rate**: % of Sprints meeting goal
- **Defect Escape Rate**: Bugs found post-Sprint
- **Team Happiness**: Regular pulse surveys

#### Cumulative Flow Diagram
- Visualizes work item flow
- Identifies bottlenecks
- Shows WIP (Work in Progress) limits
- Tracks cycle time trends

## Scaling Scrum

## Common Anti-Patterns

### 1. Process Anti-Patterns
- **Water-Scrum-Fall**: Waterfall planning with Scrum execution
- **Sprint Planning Without Estimates**: Overcommitting
- **Skipping Retrospectives**: Missing improvement opportunities
- **Product Owner Proxy**: Delayed decision-making
- **Part-time Scrum Master**: Insufficient process support

### 2. Team Anti-Patterns
- **Hero Culture**: Individual over team success
- **Silent Daily Scrums**: No real communication
- **Technical Debt Ignorance**: Focusing only on features
- **Absent Product Owner**: Unclear requirements
- **External Task Assignment**: Breaking self-organization

### 3. Management Anti-Patterns
- **Velocity as Performance Metric**: Gaming the system
- **Comparing Team Velocities**: Different contexts
- **Mid-Sprint Scope Changes**: Disrupting focus
- **Skipping Ceremonies**: "Too busy" for process
- **Command and Control**: Undermining self-organization

## Tools and Software

### 1. Digital Scrum Boards

- **Virtual Coffee Breaks**: Maintain team bonding

### 2. Communication
- **Async Updates**: Daily written standups
- **Documentation**: More detailed than co-located
- **Over-communication**: Err on side of sharing
- **Regular Check-ins**: 1-on-1 video calls
- **Virtual Team Building**: Online activities

### 3. Tools Setup
```yaml
# Remote Team Toolkit
Communication:
  - Primary: Slack/Teams
  - Video: Zoom/Meet
  - Async: Loom/Documentation

2. **Partial Implementation**: Cherry-picking practices
3. **Ignoring Technical Excellence**: Process without engineering
4. **Fixed Mindset**: Not adapting to context
5. **Documentation Extremes**: Too much or too little
6. **Estimation Obsession**: Precision over accuracy
7. **Tool Over Process**: Technology won't fix dysfunction
8. **Fake Agile**: Waterfall with Scrum terminology
9. **Micromanagement**: Destroying self-organization
10. **Ceremony Theater**: Going through motions without value
