## Core Concepts

### Issue Management
- **Issues**: Basic work items (User Stories, Tasks, Bugs, Epics)
- **Issue Types**: Categories of work (Story, Bug, Task, Epic, Sub-task)
- **Issue Status**: Current state (To Do, In Progress, Done)
- **Priority**: Importance level (Highest, High, Medium, Low, Lowest)
- **Components**: Logical groupings within projects
- **Labels**: Flexible tagging system for categorization

### Project Structure
- **Projects**: Containers for issues and configuration
- **Versions**: Release milestones and fix versions
- **Workflows**: Rules governing issue status transitions
- **Permissions**: Access control for projects and operations
- **Screens**: Forms for creating and editing issues

### Agile Frameworks
- **Scrum**: Sprint-based development with defined ceremonies
- **Kanban**: Continuous flow with work-in-progress limits
- **Boards**: Visual representation of work and workflow
- **Epics**: Large work items broken down into smaller stories
- **Sprints**: Time-boxed iterations for Scrum teams

### Reporting and Analytics
- **Dashboards**: Customizable overviews of project status
- **Gadgets**: Individual reporting widgets
- **Reports**: Built-in and custom reports for insights
- **JQL**: JIRA Query Language for advanced searching
- **Filters**: Saved searches for recurring queries

-- Stories without story points
project = "MYPROJ" AND issuetype = Story AND "Story Points" is EMPTY AND status != Done

-- Issues updated in last week
project = "MYPROJ" AND updated >= -1w

-- Overdue issues
project = "MYPROJ" AND due < now() AND status not in (Done, Closed)

-- Issues by component and status
project = "MYPROJ" AND component = "Frontend" AND status in ("In Progress", "Code Review")

## Best Practices

### Project Setup and Configuration
1. **Consistent Naming**: Use clear, consistent naming conventions for projects, components, and fields
2. **Proper Issue Hierarchy**: Establish clear relationships between Epics, Stories, Tasks, and Sub-tasks
3. **Component Strategy**: Organize components logically by team ownership or system architecture
4. **Version Management**: Plan version/release structure early and maintain consistency
5. **Workflow Design**: Keep workflows simple and aligned with team processes

### Issue Management
1. **Clear Descriptions**: Write detailed, actionable issue descriptions with acceptance criteria
2. **Proper Prioritization**: Use priority levels consistently across the organization
3. **Story Point Estimation**: Implement consistent story point estimation practices
4. **Regular Grooming**: Conduct regular backlog grooming sessions to maintain issue quality
5. **Link Related Issues**: Use issue linking to show relationships and dependencies

### Agile Practices
1. **Sprint Planning**: Conduct thorough sprint planning with the whole team
2. **Daily Standups**: Use JIRA boards during daily standups for visual progress tracking
3. **Sprint Reviews**: Demonstrate completed work using JIRA reports and dashboards
4. **Retrospectives**: Track action items from retrospectives as JIRA issues
5. **Velocity Tracking**: Monitor team velocity to improve sprint planning accuracy

### Reporting and Analytics
1. **Regular Dashboard Reviews**: Create and review dashboards regularly with stakeholders

### Cross-Team Dependency Management
```yaml
# Example dependency mapping
team_dependencies:
  frontend_team:
    depends_on:
      - backend_team: "API endpoints"
      - design_team: "UI mockups"
    provides:
      - qa_team: "UI components"
      - mobile_team: "Shared components"
  
  backend_team:
    depends_on:
      - devops_team: "Infrastructure"
      - data_team: "Database schema"
    provides:
      - frontend_team: "API endpoints"
      - mobile_team: "API endpoints"
```

## Do's and Don'ts

### Do's
✅ **Define clear acceptance criteria** for all user stories
✅ **Use consistent estimation practices** across the team
