## Effective Communication Patterns

### 1. Clear Task Descriptions
```markdown
# Good Examples:

✅ "Create a React component for user authentication with email and password fields, form validation, and error handling"

✅ "Refactor the database queries in userService.ts to use prepared statements and add proper error handling"

✅ "Add unit tests for the calculateTotal function covering edge cases like negative numbers and null values"

# Poor Examples:

❌ "Fix the code"
❌ "Make it better"
❌ "Add some tests"
```

### 2. Providing Context
```markdown
# When reporting issues:

"I'm getting a TypeScript error in src/components/UserProfile.tsx on line 45. 
The error says 'Property 'email' does not exist on type 'User''. 
The User type is defined in src/types/user.ts"

# When requesting features:

"Add a search feature to the products page that:
- Filters products by name and description
- Updates results in real-time as the user types
- Shows a loading indicator during search
- Displays 'No results found' when appropriate"
```

## Working with Complex Projects

### 1. Large Codebases
```markdown
# Best Practices for Large Projects:

1. Use /plan mode for complex features
2. Break down tasks into smaller, manageable chunks
3. Provide file paths when referencing specific code
4. Use the todo list to track progress
5. Regularly commit changes with descriptive messages
```

### 2. Multi-File Operations
```markdown
# When working across multiple files:

1. Clearly specify which files need modification
2. Describe the relationships between files
3. Use consistent naming conventions
4. Request verification after complex changes
```

## Code Review and Testing

### 1. Requesting Code Review
```markdown
# Effective code review requests:

"Review the authentication implementation in:
- src/services/auth.service.ts
- src/middleware/auth.middleware.ts
- src/routes/auth.routes.ts

Focus on:
- Security best practices
- Error handling
- Input validation
- JWT token management"
```

### 2. Testing Strategies
```markdown
# Comprehensive testing approach:

"Write tests for the UserService class that cover:
- Happy path scenarios
- Error conditions
- Edge cases
- Mock external dependencies
- Test async operations
- Verify error messages"
```

## Performance Optimization

### 1. Identifying Bottlenecks
```markdown
# Performance analysis request:

"Analyze the performance of the dashboard component:
- Check for unnecessary re-renders
- Identify expensive computations
- Look for memory leaks
- Suggest optimization strategies"
```

### 2. Optimization Techniques
```markdown
# Common optimizations Claude Code can help with:

- React: useMemo, useCallback, React.memo, lazy loading
- Database: Query optimization, indexing, caching
- API: Response caching, pagination, data compression
- Build: Code splitting, tree shaking, minification
```

## Debugging Assistance

### 1. Error Diagnosis
```markdown
# Effective error reporting:

"I'm getting this error when running npm start:
```
Error: Cannot find module 'express'
    at Function.Module._resolveFilename (internal/modules/cjs/loader.js:815:15)
```

The error occurs after pulling the latest changes from main branch."
```

### 2. Debugging Strategies
```markdown
# Claude Code can help with:

1. Adding console.log statements strategically
2. Setting up debugger configurations
3. Writing debug utilities
4. Implementing error boundaries
5. Adding logging middleware
```

## Security Best Practices

### 1. Security Review
```markdown
# Request security analysis:

"Review the authentication system for security vulnerabilities:
- Check for SQL injection risks
- Validate JWT implementation
- Review password hashing
- Check for XSS vulnerabilities
- Verify CORS configuration"
```

### 2. Secure Coding
```markdown
# Claude Code automatically:

- Never commits secrets or API keys
- Uses environment variables for sensitive data
- Implements proper input validation
- Follows OWASP guidelines
- Uses secure password hashing (bcrypt, argon2)
```

## Documentation Generation

### 1. Code Documentation
```markdown
# Request documentation:

"Generate JSDoc comments for all functions in src/utils/helpers.ts
Include:
- Function description
- Parameter types and descriptions
- Return type and description
- Example usage"
```

### 2. Project Documentation
```markdown
# Generate comprehensive docs:

"Create a README.md that includes:
- Project overview
- Installation instructions
- Configuration steps
- API documentation
- Contributing guidelines
- License information"
```

## Git Workflow

### 1. Commit Best Practices
```markdown
# Claude Code commit standards:

- Clear, descriptive commit messages
- Follows conventional commits when requested
- Groups related changes
- Never commits broken code
- Includes all necessary files
```

### 2. Branch Management
```markdown
# Working with branches:

"Create a new feature branch called 'feature/user-authentication'
Then implement:
- Login component
- Registration component
- Password reset flow
- Session management"
```

## Productivity Tips

### 1. Keyboard Shortcuts
```markdown
# Essential shortcuts:

- Cmd/Ctrl + K: Open command palette
- Cmd/Ctrl + Enter: Submit message
- Cmd/Ctrl + Shift + C: Copy code block
- Cmd/Ctrl + /: Toggle comment
- Cmd/Ctrl + L: Clear conversation
```

### 2. Workflow Optimization
```markdown
# Efficient workflows:

1. Use /plan for complex tasks
2. Batch related changes together
3. Use todo lists for multi-step processes
4. Request file creation instead of showing code
5. Ask for specific file modifications
```

## Common Patterns

### 1. Full-Stack Development
```markdown
# Typical full-stack request:

"Create a complete CRUD API for products:
- Database schema (PostgreSQL)
- Express routes with validation
- Service layer with business logic
- React components for UI
- Integration tests"
```

### 2. Refactoring
```markdown
# Refactoring request:

"Refactor the user controller to:
- Extract business logic to service layer
- Implement proper error handling
- Add input validation
- Use async/await instead of callbacks
- Add TypeScript types"
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### 1. Context Loss
```markdown
Problem: Claude Code loses context of previous changes
Solution: 
- Reference specific files and line numbers
- Provide brief recap of recent changes
- Use /context command to check current state
```

#### 2. Large File Handling
```markdown
Problem: Working with very large files
Solution:
- Break files into smaller modules
- Work on specific sections
- Use search to find relevant code
- Request targeted modifications
```

#### 3. Complex Dependencies
```markdown
Problem: Managing complex project dependencies
Solution:
- Maintain clear package.json
- Document dependency purposes
- Use lock files (package-lock.json)
- Regular dependency updates
```

## Integration with Other Tools

### 1. VS Code Integration
```markdown
# Working alongside VS Code:

- Claude Code respects .gitignore
- Follows .editorconfig settings
- Uses project ESLint/Prettier configs
- Integrates with existing tooling
```

### 2. CI/CD Pipeline
```markdown
# CI/CD compatibility:

"Set up GitHub Actions workflow for:
- Running tests on PR
- Linting and formatting checks
- Building production bundle
- Deploying to staging/production"
```
